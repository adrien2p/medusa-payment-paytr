## Description

This package provides a set of components to have a Sentry dashboard right within your admin interface, allowing you to get an overview of what is happening without needing to leave your admin panel.

It also provides JavaScript error and performance monitoring, helping you resolve JavaScript errors with maximum efficiency rather than maximum effort. You can obtain actionable insights to resolve JavaScript performance issues and track, debug, and fix JavaScript errors across different platforms.

## Getting started

> ### Requirements
> To use this library, the `medusa-plugin-sentry` needs to be installed on your server
> as it is responsible for providing the necessary data.

First of all, you need to install the plugin as follows:

<Tabs items={['npm', 'yarn']}>
  <Tab>
    ```shell
    npm install medusa-plugin-sentry-ui
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
    ```shell
    yarn add medusa-plugin-sentry-ui
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

To set up the Sentry dashboard in your Medusa admin interface, follow these steps:
<CircleStep index={1}>
Open the `src/pages/a.js` file and add the following component above the `Routes`:
```javascript
import { medusaUrl } from "../services/config"
import { Sentry } from "medusa-plugin-sentry-ui"

const SentryRoute = () => {
  const location = useLocation()
  const organisation = "YOUR_ORGA_ON_SENTRY"
  const project = "YOUR_PROJECt_ON_SENTRY"
  
  return (
    <Router>
        <Sentry path="/" baseUrl={medusaUrl} organisation={organisation} project={project} location={location} />
    </Router>
  )
}
```

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
  Be sure to replace `YOUR_ORGA_ON_SENTRY` and `YOUR_PROJECT_ON_SENTRY` with the corresponding values for your Sentry account and project
</Callout>
</CircleStep>

<CircleStep index={2}>
Next, add the following code to the `Routes` component, below the other routes:
```javascript
<SentryRoute path="sentry/*"/>
```
</CircleStep> 
<CircleStep index={3}>
Finally, to add a link to the Sentry dashboard in the sidebar menu, go to `src/components/organisms/sidebar/index.tsx` and add the following menu item:
```javascript
<SidebarMenuItem
    pageLink={"/a/sentry"}
    icon={<ClockIcon size={ICON_SIZE} />}
    triggerHandler={triggerHandler}
    text={"Sentry"}
/>
```
</CircleStep> 
You can now launch your admin and navigate to the page to view your Sentry dashboard in action! 🚀
